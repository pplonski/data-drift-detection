# Data Drift Detection

**Change is the only constant in life** - Heraclitus

Let's monitor the data drift! We will use <a href="https://github.com/evidentlyai" target="_blank">Evidently</a> package for this - you can monitor and detect data drifts in 3 lines of Python code! 🐍

Below you can find two example dashboards for drift monitoring and detection, one for classification, and one for regression task. 

The Evidently can build performance dashboards for ML models, below dashboard for Random Forest regressor built on Bike Sharing dataset. Enjoy! 😊
